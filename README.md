**Building** that&#39;s what I am all about. When I look back it seems rather a short run from building something out of Lego blocks to building C# solution by hitting `ctrl + shift + b` in Visual Studio.

Be it building **3D Printer** to **Drone** as personal projects or writing **authentication server** for  a corporate. I always love creating something new, bringing some value to the table. 

I have been writing computer code since last 4+ plus years using various languages like C# (mostly), Java and Python. I believe in using any language/technology which can solve your problem best rather than confining to single language.

I am always ready for some challenges which are on technical edge and gives satisfaction when achieved. Also eager to learn something new and more importantly implement something new.
